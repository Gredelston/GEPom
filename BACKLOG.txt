(BUG) Tmux changes wrong window title
- Correct behavior: Should always change the title of the window running gepom.
- Implementation idea: During init, change the title to the pomodoro emoji at the beginning, then use libtmux to find and memorize which window has that title.
  - Reach goal: Do it without libtmux.

(FTR) Start the first working session immediately upon init

(FTR) When each session is finished, wait for user input, then begin the next session

(FTR) Listen for user input: (q) to quit

(FTR) Check if user has tmux installed, and if not, don't run the tmux parts.

(FTR) Allow the tmux option based on a command-line flag
- Create a .preferences file which creates the flag's default
