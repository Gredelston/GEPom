# Bugs

* Tmux: Currently, always changes the title of the active window. Should only change the title of THIS window.
  * Implementation idea: Change the title at the beginning, then use libtmux to find which window has that title.

# Features

* Make it go into the main loop from the get-go
* Allow it to run even if you don't have Tmux installed
  * Allow tmux to run based on a command-line flag
  * Create a Preferences file (in .gitignore)
* Separate into files
* Sync to github

# Later
